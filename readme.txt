This Web Based application provides a MVC style web built for IIS/C#/JAVASCRIPT and a REST based API 
(the back end API code is not included here) that demonstrates programming for a complex construction
pipeline application that was designed to allow users (Contractors in this code) to make Point of Connection
(POC) Requests, which then were stored via the API in a sql server 2016 back end.  There are controllers
for handling COMPANYS, CONTACTS, INSPECTION REQUESTS, PROJECT REQUESTS and more, including a full Security
system based on the ASP.NET Identity 2.0 model.

This application was built with TELERIK's ASP.NET controls (a free 30 day download), so it may not compile/run
without the controls.  In any case, it's another example of Mark Hripko's coding style and his front end
code designed to work with a REST/WEB SERVICES  API.
